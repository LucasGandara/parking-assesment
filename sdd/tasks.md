# Tasks

Create implementation tasks for change set. This command is for **full lane** only.

> **Note**: Vibe and bug lanes skip this command. They use `/sdd:plan` which combines research, tasking, and planning into a single `plan.md` file.

## Arguments

- `$ARGUMENTS` - Change set name

## Instructions

> **SDD Process**: Read `.augment/skills/sdd-state-management.md` for state management guidance.

> **Research**: When needed, delegate to `@librarian` for codebase context. See `.augment/skills/research.md` (project-local) or `~/.augment/skills/research.md` (global) for guidance.

> **Spec Format**: Use guidance from `.augment/skills/spec-format.md` (project-local) or `~/.augment/skills/spec-format.md` (global) for requirement structure.

### Setup

1. Read `changes/<name>/state.md`
2. Read `changes/<name>/proposal.md`
3. Read change-set specs from `changes/<name>/specs/**/*.md` (both `kind: new` and `kind: delta`)
4. Read any architectural thoughts in `changes/<name>/thoughts/`

### Entry Check

Apply state entry check logic from `.augment/skills/sdd-state-management.md`.

If lane is `vibe` or `bug`, redirect user to `/sdd:plan` instead.

### Collaborative Tasking

This command is a **dialogue**, not a one-way generation.

1. **Think Out Loud**: Before writing the file, present your initial thoughts on the task breakdown.
   - Generalize the requirements: Tasks should include _anything_ necessary to make the implementation successful (e.g., scaffolding, environment setup, refactoring).
   - Traceability: You MUST explicitly call out which specific spec requirements are covered by each task.
   - Explain _why_ you're grouping certain requirements and why you've chosen a specific order (e.g., maintaining system stability, foundation-first).
2. **Present Options**: If there are multiple valid ways to slice the work (e.g., horizontal vs vertical, foundation-first vs feature-first), present them to the user with trade-offs.
3. **Invite Feedback**: Explicitly ask the user if they have specific preferences for task granularity or if there's a specific logical flow they want to follow to maintain system stability.
4. **Iterate**: Only write `tasks.md` once a consensus on the strategy has been reached.

Update state.md `## Notes` with task breakdown decisions and rationale.

### Task Structure

Create `changes/<name>/tasks.md` using checkbox-style progress tracking:

- `[ ]` = Pending
- `[o]` = In Progress (exactly one task at a time)
- `[x]` = Complete

```markdown
# Tasks: <name>

## Overview

Brief summary of what these tasks accomplish.

## Tasks

### [ ] <Title>

**Description:**
What this task accomplishes. Focus on why it exists and what it changes.

**Requirements:**

#### Foundations & Prerequisites (if any, else skip)

- <Description of technical prerequisite, scaffolding, or environment setup needed for success>

#### <spec-path>

- "<full EARS requirement line>"
  ...
```

### Task Ordering & Logic

Design tasks to ensure the application is **never in a broken state** and can be **committed after every task**.

1. **Foundations First**: Models, types, interfaces, and database migrations.
2. **Implementation Slices**: Implement functionality in vertical slices that introduce new code paths behind flags or as new modules before wiring them in.
3. **Integration**: Connect new components to existing systems.
4. **Validation**: Test suites, cleanup of old paths, and consolidation.

Order tasks by dependency. A task is only "done" when the system is stable and committable.

### Task Granularity

Each task should be:

- Completable in one implementation session
- Independently testable
- Clear on what "done" means

### Requirement Mapping

- Every requirement in change-set specs must map to at least one task
- Tasks MUST reference requirements by quoting the full EARS line and specifying the source spec file
- Use spec format guidance to understand requirement structure

### Completion

When they explicitly approve tasks:

1. Update state.md: `## Phase Status: complete`, clear `## Notes`
2. Suggest running `/sdd:plan <name>` to plan first task

Do not log completion in `## Pending` (that section is for unresolved blockers/decisions only).
