React I4 - Promotion Assessment

Project Scenario
You are tasked with designing and implementing a Parking Management System for a residential community. The system must handle parking spot allocation, assign spots through a raffle that rotates every three months, and ensure fairness by prioritizing residents who were not selected in the previous cycle.
The solution should also be designed with future expansion in mind. Potential advanced features may include:
•	Real-time vehicle detection using license plate recognition cameras
•	Support for different vehicle types (Car, Motorcycle, Bicycle)
•	Importing and exporting data from spreadsheets
You have full freedom to decide how to implement the features. Adding extra functionality, thoughtful details, or enhancements beyond the core requirements is encouraged.
