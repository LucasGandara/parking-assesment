# Plan: Auth Layout Component

## Objective

Build the shared two-panel layout component rendered on both `/login` and
`/register`. The left panel carries ParkSmart AI branding; the right panel
is a slot for the page's form. A footer is rendered below both panels.

## Requirements (from specs/auth/layout.md)

- "The system SHALL render a two-panel layout on the `/login` and
  `/register` pages."
- "The system SHALL render a left panel containing the ParkSmart AI logo,
  the tagline "Intelligent Parking Management System", a list of feature
  highlights, and a parking-themed image."
- "The system SHALL render a right panel containing the authentication form
  for the current page."
- "The system SHALL render a footer on both the `/login` and `/register`
  pages with the text "Need help? Contact your building administrator.""
- "The system SHALL render the footer contact text as a hyperlink pointing
  to a configurable administrator email address."

## Files

| File | Action |
|------|--------|
| `src/auth/components/auth-layout.tsx` | Create |
| `src/auth/components/auth-layout.module.scss` | Create |
| `src/routes/login.tsx` | Update — wrap with AuthLayout |
| `src/routes/register.tsx` | Update — wrap with AuthLayout |

## Steps

### Step 1 — AuthLayout component

`src/auth/components/auth-layout.tsx`

- Accept `children: ReactNode` (right panel slot)
- Render outer wrapper, left panel, right panel, footer
- Admin email from `import.meta.env.VITE_ADMIN_EMAIL` with fallback

### Step 2 — SCSS module

`src/auth/components/auth-layout.module.scss`

- `.auth-layout` — flex column, min-height 100vh
- `.auth-layout__panels` — CSS grid, two equal columns
- `.auth-layout__left` — dark brand background, column flex
- `.auth-layout__right` — center-aligned form slot
- `.auth-layout__footer` — bottom bar, centered text

### Step 3 — Wire into routes

Update `login.tsx` and `register.tsx` to wrap placeholder content in
`<AuthLayout>`.

## Validation

- [ ] `/login` renders two-panel layout with branding on left
- [ ] `/register` renders two-panel layout with branding on left
- [ ] Footer appears on both pages with mailto link
- [ ] `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check-types` pass
